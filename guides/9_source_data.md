# Source Data from CLDR

Data is from the ICU's CLDR project in [json](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-json) format.  The content is configured as a set of submodules in the [Cldr github](https://github.com/kipcole9/cldr) repository.  This content is not part of the hex package since it is used only to generate a consoldiated and canonical format for use in `Cldr`.
