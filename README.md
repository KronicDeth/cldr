**Source data**

Generated by:

Data is from the ICU's CLDR project when is downloaded in XML format.  For ease of consumption it is then converted to `json` format with the following commands:

    java -DCLDR_DIR=. -jar ../tools/tools/java/cldr.jar ldml2json -t main -p true -r true
    java -DCLDR_DIR=. -jar ../tools/tools/java/cldr.jar ldml2json -t supplemental -p true -r true

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add cldr to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:cldr, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure cldr is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:cldr]]
        end
