# Cldr

**Common locale libary for Elixir**

Just starting implementation and not ready for use.

Phase 1 is to implement rbnf and to that extent work has started on a lexer and parser for
the rule base.

Phase 2 will then be focused on finishing number formats, followed by date and time format.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add cldr to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:cldr, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure cldr is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:cldr]]
        end
